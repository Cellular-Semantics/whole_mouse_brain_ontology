# Whole Mouse Brain Ontology

The Whole Mouse Brain Ontology project constructs a data-driven cell-type ontology of the whole mouse brain. This ontology is based on the work of Zizhen Yao, Hongkui Zheng and colleagues:

Yao, Z., van Velthoven, C.T.J., Kunst, M. et al. A high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types in the whole mouse brain. Nature 624, 317â€“332 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06812-z

WMBO consists of over 5000 cell types and all terms have auto-rolled definitions and formal relationships incorporating classifications, markers and brain regions, where available, as well as links to underlying data.  Anatomical domains correspond to those in the Allen Standard [Mouse Brain Atlas Ontology](https://github.com/brain-bican/mouse_brain_atlas_ontology).
